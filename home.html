Swing music originated from Harlem, New York City, New York in the 1930s, derived from Jazz. With Swing music and its powerful drive and groove, came swing dance, and so began the Swing Era which lasted from around 1935 to 1946. Large bands made of instrumental sections of reeds, brass, and percussion filled the streets of Harlem with the sweet sounds of Swing, and it only spread around the nation. The majority of the music and dance comes from African American communities, but as swing became more popular, it grew out of these communities giving life to musicians such as Benny Goodman, the King of Swing. Swing is not only used to tell the story of Harlem but also other stories with musical theater. Musicals like "Swing!" contain no dialogue,  the story is entirely told through music and dance.</p><p><strong>Kyoto</strong></p></div>

 It originated from the Edo period  (1615-1868) as a source of stability, isolation, and unification. Like Swing, it involves many instruments, movements, and rhythms. Since the early 18th century, Kabuki had become an established art form that was capable of serious and dramatic presentations of genuinely moving situations. Theatrical kabuki centers on its music and dance to tell the story, similar to another type of music across the world.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The Two Cities Connected</strong></p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Despite being on two ends of the world, the sounds of these cities have many links. Now, as seen before, there are similarities in how these types of music are similar in use and how they affect each cities' culture but are there any other links between these two kinds of music? One may think that the sounds of these two cities have to be saying different things. While they do say different stories, they way they tell each story is the same.   Not only are these two musical cultures used in dance and theater, but from melody and instrumentation to texture and harmony, these two cultures of music also have much more in common than is seen to the naked eye or ear.</p><p><br></p><p>*Definitions for <strong>bolded terms</strong> are found in the musical terms page on the menu of this page.</p></div>

Here, Goodman uses many sharps, but to make the piece stand out he uses a natural accidental to have the same striking feature as in <em>Echigojishi. </em>Alternate tones are included in each piece with the use of accidentals, sharps in<em> Echigojishi </em>and flats in <em>Sing Sing Sing.</em></p><p><em>Here is an example of this technique in measures 7, 8, and 12 in Sing Sing Sing</em></p><p></p></div>

Due to this, the melody is disjunct in both Goodman's and Rokuzaemon's pieces. This adds to the chaotic, fast-paced themes of the two pieces. While Sing Sing Sing has a 4/4 time signature, it is composed in cut time which matches the pace of Echigojishi's 2/4 time signature. We see a combination of quarter notes, eighth notes, and the rare occurrence of a dotted quarter note. The melody is continuously fast paced with this.&nbsp;</p><p>Being an upbeat swing song, <em>Sing Sing Sing </em>is filled with polyrhythms. The introduction begins with a compelling percussionist beat at 8th and 16th notes. However, after the 4th measure, the percussion starts the second beat with half 
notes, as a counter-rhythm to the fast pace of the 8th and 16th notes. The notes are accented differently with each of the instruments as well to provide different sets of articulation and <strong>prosody</strong> in the performance. The polyrhythms do not just exist solely in the percussion. The other instruments play opposing rhythms as well that include sets of quarter notes that the Baritones, Altos, and Tenors play. Moving towards the center of the piece, many&nbsp;<strong>arpeggios</strong> of various instruments are seen. The constant change in rhythm along with the variance of it with the instruments provide a sense of busyness.&nbsp;</p></div>

Here, this piece starts off with a sharp percussion ensemble similar to <em>Sing Sing Sing. </em>The percussion begins with a slower rhythm filled with quarter notes and rests as the flutes intervene in the second measure with a counter rhythm to the percussion. As things speed up, then hear a <strong>false cadence</strong> early in the song with a whole measure rest then a drum roll with the percussion and flutes to introduce the melody of the shamisen. The flutes play a final arpeggio, and we hear the vibrant sound of the shamisen with a rhythm filled with 8th notes that speeds up the song. In the background, we continue to hear the flutes and percussion with a counter melody and rhythm. Together the instrumentation of the piece forms a chaotic sound, one of the reasons why <em>Echigojishi </em>is also known as &nbsp;<em>The Lion of Echigo.</em></p></div>

Harmony is the <em>vertical </em>organization of notes, in other words, chords. Harmonic chords are described as major, minor, <strong>augmented, </strong>or<strong> diminished</strong>, and is often described regarding its harshness, being <strong>dissonant </strong>or<strong> consonant</strong>. Harmony gives texture to a piece, and it plays the supporting role to the melody in a piece. Texture is can be of three things: <strong>monophonic, polyphonic, </strong>or<strong> homophonic</strong>. Melody, harmony, and texture come together to form the timbre, or the tone color, of a composition.&nbsp;</p><p>As mentioned before both Goodman's and Rokuzaemon's compositions are of minor tones. In <em>Sing Sing Sing</em> there is a chord progression of Am Bb G Em G# C#m. The harmony of this song is quite dissonant because of this and is also due to the multiple melodies that overlap each other with different pitches as well due to the vast instrumentalization. The fast paced and chaotic theme of the song also correlates to the piece's diminuation of notes with 8th notes. This is done to make the piece seem more hurried.</p></div>

This plays a highly essential component to the theme and timbre of the song. The divergent sounds of a harsh plucked shamisen and the softer melody and harmonization of the flutes in Echigojishi and the bright tones of a trumpet changing with varying verses into a more upbeat haunting sound near the end which contradicts the lower sounds the trombone are all examples of dissonance in the pieces overall harmonization.
</p><p>With this comes the polyphonic component of the compositions. You can hear the various melodies, and counter melodies played by the instruments as seen with its dissonance. Each piece has multiple layers to the composition that vary widely. It is unlike other arrangements in other musical culture like Beethoven or Scott Joplin which mainly are either monophonic or homophonic. 
</p><p>We then move onto the pieces' timbre. Both are mainly used for dancing or theatrical acts, the tone color of each composition is very resonant and lively but continue to have dark tones due to the minor chords of the pieces. The <strong>tonality</strong> of<em> Sing Sing Sing </em>focuses on the C#m, but there is chord progression. While Echigojishi does not have the same chord progression, it is still tonal with a focus on a C#m as well.  The flutes and drums in <em>Echigojishi</em> set a festive atmosphere, giving the shamisen a background for it to provide the haunting tones of the piece. In <em>Sing Sing Sing</em> the trumpets take the lead with the melody giving the arrangement the swinging vibe while the trombones give the composition it's darker brassier sounds.</p></div>

I chose swing primarily because I have always loved it. Its upbeat and rhythmic tunes make me want to get up and dance. The brass and strings in the swing music also blend so well, and while it is dramatic, it still has a sense of lightness to it. I chose Kabuki music because I have been getting more interested in modern day Japanese music and I wanted to look back at more traditional types of Japanese music. While this is a traditional form of music in Japan, it was used for dramas, making it very amusing and fun to listen to.</div></div>
